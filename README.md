# Sentiment Classifier
a quick NLP model to detect the tone of yelp restaurant reviews.

## Tools
- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- sklearn

## To Use
The code comes with a built in function to input your own restaurant reviews after training the existing dataset. The current accuracy is around 75% for detecting the correct tone of any review, but is very very accurate for those that are shorter and more concise (<50 words).
